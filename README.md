## Express Playgrounds 
This repository contains sample code for a demo "items" application built on 
Express, NodeJs and Typescript. 

The project is meant as a learning and exploration playground for Express 
and NodeJS. Feel free to poke around and submit PRs if you think something 
should be changed or can be done differently.
